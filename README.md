# weather-app

This weather app will search by city name and return the current weather as well as a five day forcast and then dynamically display them to the screen.

this is completed by performing multiple API calls, one by city name and then the second by latitude and longitude. The second Api call is needed to get the UV rating since it isn't included in the first API call.

here you can see the weather app in action.
